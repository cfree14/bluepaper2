Equity considerations must be at the forefront of all fisheries management endeavors, with efforts to understand the likely local impacts of climate change, and to build resilience by implementing best-management practices to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and foster adaptive and responsive decision-making targeted at vulnerable communities. 

Stock assessments that account for productivity shifts and non-stationary population dynamics will be necessary in a warming ocean (Punt et al. 2014). See Pinksy and Mantua (2014) for a review of opportunities. The incorporation of environmental drivers and ecosystem metrics into stock assessments and management decisions can also be valuable (Marshall et al. 2018). 

Harvest control strategies should leave large buffers around targets to account for uncertainty, and should prioritize the preservation of stock and ecosystem reserves, rather than maximizing yield.

Ironically, in the extreme cases where selective breeding allows farming of aquaculture species in settings where they no longer can live as wild stocks, this potential challenge from escapement may be lessened. Regardless, selective breeding to meet the challenges of climate change must always be done in the context of continuing to minimize the negative footprint of aquaculture on coastal ecosystems.
