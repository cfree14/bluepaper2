Hi Erin
 

The draft looks good and I only have one comment on the aquaculture section.

In Palau and I suspect, many other small islands, the issue is not regulations but maybe lack of expertise and entrepreneurship to fully develop the aquaculture industry.  Many project over the years in Palau have tried to develop different aquaculture and many have failed after the grants run out or initial funding stops.  The longest running aquaculture now is the clam hatchery that is run by the government and highly subsidized.  They spawn the clam, rear them and sell the small clams to farmers at very low cost.  The farmers would just put them in the water, wait for them to grow a bit, then sell them to restaurant or to exporters.  Without the support of the government facility, the farmers would not be able to make money from it.

While I am not sure how many small islands have the same situation in Palau or how significant this is globally but I want to raise it to see what you guys think about it.

 

That is my only comment.

 

Thanks

Yim
